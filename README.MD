# Arcade Kiosk
## What is it?
Arcade Kiosk is inspired from Skyfall's [Arcade Monitor](https://github.com/SkyfallWasTaken/arcade-monitor/), but has a crucial difference. While Arcade Monitor is a bot, Arcade Kiosk is a chrome extension that sends a browser notification when a change in the HackClub Arcade shop is detected.
## How does it work?
Arcade Kiosk automatically calls [Arcade's API](https://hackclub.com/api/arcade/shop/) once every 5 minutes, although a user can manually request a fetch. Should the user miss a browser notification, they can also view a history of all shop changes. Additionally, a user can choose to only be notified when a specific item changes, or ignore other items (looking at you, Yubikey). 
## How do I install this?
